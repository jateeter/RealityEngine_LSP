# This used to exec a deprecated prototype's stopUniverse.sh whenever it was
# executable, and only fall back to the native stop when it was missing. That
# made teardown depend on a repository deprecated in June 2026 and frozen since
# — and on a developer machine where the checkout still exists, the delegation
# was the path that actually ran. Multi-engine teardown belongs to
# RealityEngine_CI/stopUniverse.sh; this stops the local engines and nothing
# else.
